        Hello! Thanks for visiting :)
        <br>
        <br>
        I am a graduate student in Communication Design living and studying in New York. I
        primarily work in user interface and graphic design, but have a personal
        interest in illustration and Asian studies. I was born in Beijing,
        China, but also lived in Australia and Los Angeles. I moved to the
        United States when I was in 7th grade, straddling the space between
        first generation and second generation Chinese American immigrants,
        being neither yet relating to both. I aim to use this unique position to
        explore my understanding of the East and the West, and of the changes in
        culture and communication that occur when items are brought from one to
        the other.
